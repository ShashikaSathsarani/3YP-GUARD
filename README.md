## 🐠 What is G.U.A.R.D?

## General Unit for Aquatic Risk Detection

### A Modular Safety & Monitoring System for Multi-Tank Ornamental Fish Shops

**G.U.A.R.D** is a smart monitoring and automation system designed to continuously watch aquarium conditions and immediately alert the owner before damage happens.

**Goal:** Prevent fish mortality, reduce manual work, and improve reliability using automation and real-time monitoring.

---

## ❗Mortivation

### Practical Problems

Ornamental fish shops manage multiple aquariums simultaneously, each containing species with different environmental requirements.
Small invisible changes in water quality can quickly lead to fish stress, disease, or death — often before the owner notices.

However:

* Manual testing is slow and reactive
* Measurements are sometimes inaccurate
* Continuous monitoring is impossible for humans


### Real-World Impact

| Impact            | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Financial Loss    | Expensive fish (ex: Arowana) may die |
| Reputation Damage | Customer trust decreases             |
| Labor Stress      | Staff must constantly check tanks    |


---

## 🚫 Why Existing Solutions Are Not Enough

Current aquarium systems are mostly designed for **single home aquariums**.

They suffer from:

* No scalability
* No modular expansion
* Expensive to scale
* Limited alert features
* No centralized monitoring


---


## 🔍 Core Features

### Water Monitoring

The system continuously measures critical water parameters:

* Temperature
* pH
* Ammonia
* Water Level
* Turbidity

### Alert System

* Mobile notifications
* Web dashboard alerts
* Local LED indicators

### Automation

* Automatic filtration
* Water circulation control
* Optional water change
* Automatic fish feeding
* Lighting control

### Intelligence & Dashboard

* Real-time monitoring
* Historical data visualization
* Centralized control panel

### Scalability

* Plug-and-play tank modules
* Multi-tank architecture
* Easy expansion without shutdown

## 🏗 System Architecture

```
Sensors → Microcontroller → Cloud → User Interface → Actuators
```

### Data Flow

1. Sensors read water parameters
2. ESP32 processes and evaluates thresholds
3. Data stored locally + cloud
4. Alerts sent to user
5. System automatically reacts (heater/pump/feeder)
